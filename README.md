# MovieCloud

A modern and user-friendly website to browse your favorite Movies, TV Shows, and Actors.

## Introduction

### Goals

I wanted to create a website that would:

- Be a great addition for my portfolio.
- Challenge me to step outside the technology scope of my previous projects and learn the technologies would most appropriate for a website like this.
- Deliver a beautiful modern design with great User Experience.

### Challenges

Although this website may seem simple and straight-forward at a glance, there is some complex logic under the hood to ensure vistors have the absolute best User Experience possible. During the build process I've learnt and gain experience in:

- Lifecycle of a React Component and importance of each lifecycle method.
- React design patterns (HOC, Render Props etc).
- Effectively managing and maintaining Redux application state. Separating actions and using multiple reducers for better readibility and more predictable logic.
- Single page application routing with React Router Library.
- Guarding API response data to test JSON shape before injecting into application.
- Experimenting with different folder structures and understanding the pros and cons of each.
- Displaying loading and error states for enhanded User Experience.
- Creating smooth and seamless animations with Framer Motion.
- Responsive Design with SCSS media queries.
